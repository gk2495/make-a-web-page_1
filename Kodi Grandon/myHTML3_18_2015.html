      <h4>The World Wide Web</h4>
      <p>
        The <b><em>World Wide Web</em></b> was developed in the early 1990s and has around 30 billion pages. The <b><em> World Wide Web</em></b> is a collection of HTML documents. These documents are made up of HTML. Click the following link to

      <h4>Web Concept</h4>
      <p>
        The major pieces of the web are you, your computer running a web browser, the internet, and servers. When you go to a web page your computer sends a HTTP request to a server. The server gets the HTML document and sends it back to the user where a web browser interprets the page and displays it. Click the following link to

     <h4>HTML Basics</h4>
    <p>
      <b><em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em></b> is the basis for almost every webpage. HTML is the main type of document on the web. It is what glues everything together such as documents, images, and videos. There are many types of files that can be found on the web such as Plain text, HTML, Images, Videos, and Music.Click the following link to

    </p>
    <p>
      HTML is made up of Text content (what you see), Markup (what it looks like), reference to other documents (like images and videos), and links to other pages. Click the following link to

    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="art">
    <h4>HTML Markup, Tags, Attributes, Elements</h4>
    <p>
      HTML Markup is made up of <b><em>Tags</em></b>. Opening Tags are different from Closing Tags in that Closing Tags have a (/) in front of them. Some examples of tags are &lt;b&gt; = bold and &lt;em&gt; = italic tags.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tags can have multiple <b><em>Attributes</em></b>. An example of a tag that uses an <b>Attribute</b> is the &lt;a&gt; tag = Anchor tag.  The &lt;a&gt; tag can use<em>( href=)</em> to create a hyperlink. Another tag that can use an Attribute is the &lt;img&gt; tag.  The &lt;img&gt; tag uses <em>(src=)</em> also known as URL.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML documents are made of elements. An <b><em>Element</em></b> can be looked as a individual component of an HTML document. Click the following link to

    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="art">
    <h4>Inline vs Block</h4>
    <p>
      <b><em>Block</em></b> elements normally start with a new line. Can have height and width "invisable boxes"  Examples: &lt;h1&gt;,  &lt;p&gt;, and  &lt;div&gt;.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><em>Inline</em></b> elements are normally displayed without line breaks. Examples:  &lt;br&gt;, &lt;b&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, and &lt;span&gt;.

     <h4>Stupid Computers</h4>
    <p>
      Computers are "stupid" because they interpret instructions or what we code literally.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="art">
     <h4>5 Most Important Things To Take</h4>
    <p>
      <b>1. What is a webpage?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      A webpage is a "<em>text document</em>" written in a language called HTML.  Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. How coding works.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Computers are stupid.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Programmers need to write <em>exactly</em> the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax)."
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Programmers cant remember everything</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are too many details to keep in your head. You can always look it up. :)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>5. Basic HTML vocabulary</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tag</b>: an HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Some tags called "void tags" do not require a closing tag like &lt;br&gt;.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Element</b>: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of openings and closing tags.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Atribute</b>: This is a property of an HTML element.

    <h2>Stage 1: Webpages, Documents, and Structure</h2>
    <div class="art">
     <h4>HTML, CSS, and DOM</h4>
     <p>
      <b>HTML</b> - Hyper Text Markup Language - the standard markup language used to create web pages.  HTML controls the structure of a webpage.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>CSS</b> - Cascading Style Sheets - style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.  CSS controls the Style of a webpage.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>DOM</b> - Document Object Model - a cross- platform and language independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML.  The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="art">
    <h4>DIV and SPAN</h4>
    <p>
      <b>&lt;Div&gt;</b> - &lt;div&gt; tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.  The &lt;div&gt; tag is used to group block-elements to format them with CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>&lt;Span&gt;</b> - The &lt;span&gt; tag is used to group inline-elements in a document.  The &lt;span&gt; tag provides no visual change by itself.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="art">
     <h4>CSS</h4>
        <p>
      CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a  markup language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Order matters with styles.  Styles can be defined in different places and are applied in the following order the default style of a browser, stylesheet in a a seperate file, stylesheet inside HTML, and inline style in an element.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="art">
     <h4>Avoiding Repetition</h4>
        <p>
      When writing code you want to avoid repetition.  Repetition will increase your likelihood of creating errors while also making your code harder to read.  A benefit of avoiding repetition in code would be efficiency in production.  Using CSS can assist with avoiding repetition. CSS enables the seperation of document content from document presentation which can reduce complexity and repetition.
    </p>
   </div>
  <div class="art">
     <h4>The Box Model</h4>
    <p>
      Boxes consist of the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Content</b> - image or test that appears on the website.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Padding</b> - clears an area around the content effected by the "backround color" of the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Border</b> - is inherited by the color property of the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Margin</b> - Clears area around the border and is transparent.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="art">
    <h4>Adding Images</h4>
    <p>
      You can add an image to a page with the tag &lt;img&gt;.  When using an image you should also remember to use the "alt" attribute which displays alternate information to the screen incase the browser cannot display the image. An example is here &lt;img src="img/app.png" alt="This is a screenshot"&gt;
  </p>
 </div>
  <div class="art">
   <h4>Code, Test, Refine</h4>
  <p>
    The simple pattern to follow when designing a page.
  </p>
  <p>
    1. Look for natural boxes.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. Look for repeated styles and semantic elements.
  </p>
  <p>
    3. Write your HTML.
  </p>
  <p>
    4. Apply Styles (from BIGGEST to smallest)
  </p>
  <p>
    5. Fix things
  </p>

  <h2>Stage 2: Telling Computers What To Do</h2>
<div class="art">
  <h4>Computer Programming and Computer Science</h4>
  <p>
    <b>Computer Programming</b> - is the process fo designing, writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code of computer programs.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Computer Science</b> - is the study of computers and their architecture, languages, and applications, in all aspects, as well as the mathematical structures that relate to computers and computation.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="art">
  <h4>Programming Language</h4>
  <p>
    <b>Programming Language</b> is a formal constructed language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer.  Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.
  </p>
</div>
  <div class="art">
    <h4>Backus-Naur Form</h4> 
    <p>
      The purpose of Backus Naur Form is to precisely describe exactly the language in a way thats very simple and concise.  BNF is often used to describe the syntax of languages used in computing, such as computer programming languages, document formats, instruction sets and communication protocols.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>non-terminal -> replacement -> terminal</em>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="art">
  <h4>Python</h4>
  <p>
    <b>Python</b> is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.  <b>Python interpreter</b> is a program that reads Python programs and carries out their instructions.
